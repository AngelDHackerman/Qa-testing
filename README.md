# Qa-testing

Here you'll find the documentation for the manual and automation testing done in several web pages in order to practice and show you all my skills as a __manual & automation__ Qa tester.

Also: within each folder you'll find a readme file in which the __objective__ of the test is describe those are the "points to test".  


All the screenshots and visual documentation you will find them on my web page: https://angeldariohs.wixsite.com/angelhackerman
